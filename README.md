# TAIKONAUT

__Taikonaut is a collection of Sass functions and mixins.__

While much of this library assists with standard practices and builds, there are also pieces that are exploratory.  As such, helpers around standard responsive design behaviors are included, but also explorations in better ways to handle typesetting given the limitations of the CSS spec and standard CSS code.  Experiments will be noted in comments before the helpers themselves.

## Prerequisites

Taikonaut assumes usage of a prefixer in efforts to stay cross-compatible and current with evolving web standards for  CSS specifications.

This was built while using [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), a common and well supported auto prefixer for CSS that works alongside [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/).
